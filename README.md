# LibreTask backend

This is the code, primarily Node.js, that powers the LibreTask backend. The app is largely considered code-complete. Future improvements will be in the form of documentation and refining existing features.

#### Running locally

1. Install Node.js (the code is tested against v8.12)
2. Install all packages: `npm install`
3. Run an instance locally: `node server.js`
    - Using the nodemon package is preferred, it will automatically reload the backend during development
        - `npm install -g nodemon`
        - `nodemon server.js`

#### Testing

More soon.
